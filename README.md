# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm LucoCalcetto

I'm interested in **AI, data labeling, and programming-related projects**.  
I currently work on platforms like **DataAnnotation**, focusing on **AI model evaluation**, **rubric creation**, and **data quality checks**.  
I'm also expanding my skills in **Python**, **SQL**, **automation**, and **machine learning fundamentals**.  

This repository collects my **learning projects** and experiments as I continue to grow in the AI and data field.
